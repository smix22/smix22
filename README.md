**`Creative Satellite (Developer/Designer/Writer)`**

Junior Full Stack Developer with a passion for Frontend and a background in Design and Journalism.

Creativity has been my lifelong companion, whether in writing, designing, or coding. As a creative problem-solver, both slick and functional solutions are my ultimate aspiration. My motivation is to design a responsible, supportive world and a future shaped by (digital) sustainability.
